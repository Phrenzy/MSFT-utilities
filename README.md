# MSFTutilities

This is a collection of files I use to streamline and update the computers I use.
It includes .reg files for registry updates as well as .ps1 to run in powershell.
Like all potentially dangerous files downloaded from the internet,
do not use these files unless you either:

	1. Know me and/or trust me.
	2. Look at the files and are confident they will do what you want them to do.
	3. Have someone you trust have a look at the file(s) to ensure they are safe.
	
This particular group of files will focus on programs and operating systems 
released by Microsoft. (FYI - MSFT is the stock ticker symbol for Microsoft
and how I abbreviate it.)

What do the files do?

removeOneDriveFromFileExplorer.reg	
	This will remove ‘OneDrive’ from the left panel in window’s file explorer in Win 10.

removeCreativeCloudFilesFromFileExplorer.reg
	This will remove ‘Creative Cloud Files’ from the left panel in window’s file explorer in Win 10.
